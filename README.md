# Assembly Algorithm Implementation
- This repository just consists of two algorithm implementations in Assembly language. It was run in Keil uVision, simulated for LH75400 ARM Processor and the two algorithm uses the memory simulator in Keil to hold the initial array that was used.

- This implementation was done to complete one of my Courseworks in the University of Nottingham Malaysia, specifically for `Systems and Architecture` module. I should clarify that it was a group assignment but the general implementation for the Heap Sort in assembly code, was of my own work. The implementation for Binary Search was done by Ibraheem Haitham (have not found his Github yet!) but had some of my touch ups.

- Please do contact me by email or Discord `xeno#3125` if you have any questions regarding this repository. Hope it proves to be useful :D.
